there are hundreds of different types of games - some played in voice mode, some in text mode, etc. The way they are structured is the AI tells the users about the rules, they start, and the AI adds its inputs as and when needed.


Icebreakers:
Ice breaker functionality - it will be in the messaging interface. The first message will be from the AI - something like - Hi Sara, Adam here also likes travelling to xyz, he also cares deeply about ABC, etc, and to Adam, Hi Adam, Sara too loves.... Once this brief context setting is done, through the rich user profile that the AI has in its memory, then it asks the two if they'd like to play some icebreaker games or activities. Or if they's like to go straight to vibe check - where they can send each other a voice note or video note in response to a suggestion or prompt, to get a better sense of the person.
If the Sara and Adam choose icebreakers, then our AI shows the list of all of the ice breaker games in our system. The users then make the choice, and this activates the prompt for that particular or activity. After this activity is over, the AI asks if they would want to continue with another ice breaking activity vibe check, or take things forward themselves. The AI can still be called at any point by @elinityai
