Smart journalling: 
This is AI-powered, thoughtfully designed and personalized journaling experience. 
We will build this on top of an OS rich text editor 
The key features: AI that asks you personalized prompt questions, proactively. AI that makes comments or metanotes on your journaling. See a list of favourite prompts and themes for the AI to ask the user. Get voice notes transcribed through a speech-to-text model. 
See key insights and takeaways from today’s journal once the process has been completed for the day. 

The AI that can read the journal, and prompt the user, ask pertinent questions, make the journaling exercise as useful, as insight-inducing, as possible.

The system prompts the user with some questions to start them off, either generic but preferred questions and sets of themes, or based on some information the model may have regarding today - say if you are working on an acutely stressful project that is upcoming, the AI, knowing that through other interactions, could start off the journaling canvas by asking the user about how they are preparing, for it, etc 
The journaling exercise can thus continue as the AI proactively and thoughtfully asks follow on questions, until the user is done for the day.
The user can also take voice notes, or have their voice transcribed by a model like Whisper 

AI in line
The AI can proactively suggest things based on the last
The user also can add some Ai generated suggestions or questions to theb journal (from greyed out to dark) 

The users voice notes are seamlessly transcribed into the smart journal - button to add voice notes, which can be transcribed or embedded in the notes 

The user can also take voice notes, or have their voice transcribed by a model like Whisper 


Voice journaling: 
The user records a voice journal, which is then transc

Proactive AI in chat window with another person: The user, the other person, and a proactive AI in the chat with the user that can be useful in all sorts of ways. In other words, a 3-way chat, with the user, the second person, and an AI that can proactively add to the conversation.  
Our model allows itself to be tuned into a real time text conversation, between the user and the person they are communicating with. This person could be one that we have recommended, or it could be the user’s friend or family member. The AI can interject at appropriate places (it should have the context of 1) the user persona model 2) the user persona model of the person they are chatting with 3) context of the messaging thread itself) (which means it should have long-term and persistent memory (current limits notwithstanding), and it should be able to chime in, either when called upon, or proactively, when useful.

For instance, with a chat window for a new person you have been recommended, the AI can start you two off by suggesting or ice breaking something like “Hey Isaac, do you Cynthia also is super passionate about alignment research and hiking, and Cynthia, Isaac is a big fan of Star Trek, just like you!”.
Another example. 
Let us say they have been talking about organizing some trip together. At that point, ElinityAI, proactively knowing the context, can jump in and suggest something they both would love to do, and asks if it should add the finalized/confirmed trip on to their respective calendars. 
It can proactively search for information too: say the trip you agreed to was a hiking one in the mountains around SF. It can comment something about the expected trek time, weather on the day, etc.
